Description             : A quake2 player model of..a hand :).
                          This is my first model, an' I think I 
                          did a reasonable job considerin' that
                          fact. The skins are ..well.. very 
                          av'rge.

Known bugs              : Yes...NULL SKIN FOUND.. :( fer some reason
                          I canna get it to go away..even afta
                          followin' the directions of tha FAQ at
                          Q2pmp (unlinkin' tha skins 'n stuff)
                          ..it's prob'ly really obvious to you
                          what the problem is, but I'm not very
                          experienced with this.
