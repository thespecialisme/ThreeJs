Model Description	: Born on the planet bearing his own name, Vegeta has the bloodline to                             become a super-elite Saiyajin. A henchman of Freeza, he is regarded as                           one of the greatest fighters in the universe. Vegeta craves nothing                              more then ultimate power.
